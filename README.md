# I - Problem Statement
## 1. Introduction

This assignment aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this assignment, apart from applying the techniques that you have learnt in the EDA module, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

I split the data file because it was too large, and I only took a sample data of 5000 rows.

## 2. Business Understanding
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.


When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

# IV - Conclusion
After analysis:

- Pensioners show a decrease in the percentage of payment difficulties, while working individuals show an increase in this percentage compared to both payment and non-payment difficulties.

- Married and widowed individuals show a decrease in loan payment difficulties, while single and civil married individuals show an increase compared to both payment and non-payment difficulties.

- There is an increase in loan payment difficulties among individuals with secondary/secondary special education and a decrease among those with completed higher education compared to both payment and non-payment difficulties.

- 'Low skilled Laborers' and 'Lower Secondary' education types have a disproportionately high percentage of payment difficulties, making them significant factors for loan defaulters.

- Banks should prioritize contract types such as Student, Pensioner, and Businessman, with housing types other than Co-op apartment or Office apartment for successful payments. Working individuals show a high number of unsuccessful payments.

- Loans with purposes related to repairs have a higher number of unsuccessful payments.

- Clients from housing types with parents show the least number of unsuccessful payments and should be targeted more by banks.
